### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Adam, and I have designed and built digital experiences for 15+ years.  I currently lead a team of exceptional designers at Elastic, where we craft new and insightful experiences to protect the worldâ€™s data.

Over my career I have spent time as a designer, engineer, and leader, usually some combination of the three.  My focus these days is on growing and mentoring effective design teams.  As a leader, I strive to give my teams the space they need to do the best work of their lives while challenging them to grow both professionally and personally.

Since I spend so much time professionally thinking about digital experiences, in my personal time, I try to decompress in the analog world as much as possible.  I am an avid tennis player, and appreciate a good hike.  I also stretch my abilities by designing and building physical objects and spaces, and always have a D.I.Y. project or two going on.
