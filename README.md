### Hi there 👋

My name is Adam, and I have designed and built digital experiences for 15+ years.  I am currently buidling a team of exceptional designers at Weights & Biases, where we craft new and insightful experiences while on a mission to build the best tools for AI.

Over my career I have spent time as a designer, engineer, and leader, usually some combination of the three.  My focus these days is on growing and mentoring effective design teams.  As a leader, I strive to give my teams the space they need to do the best work of their lives while challenging them to grow both professionally and personally.
